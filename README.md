# Contextual Language Understanding with Transformers

This project demonstrates basic contextual language understanding using transformer models. It shows how to use pre-trained transformer models to understand context in text and perform basic natural language processing tasks.

## Features
- Text classification with context
- Sentiment analysis
- Basic text understanding

## Setup
1. Create a virtual environment (recommended):
```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage
Run the main script:
```bash
python main.py
```

## Project Structure
- `main.py`: Main script containing the transformer model implementation
- `requirements.txt`: Project dependencies
- `data/`: Directory containing example data
